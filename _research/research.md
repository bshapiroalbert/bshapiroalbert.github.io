My research primarily focuses on a particular type of neutron star called a pulsar, which emit radio waves like a lighthouse. By observing these radio waves, I have studied a special family of pulsars called rotating radio transients (RRATs), as well as studied how the interstellar medium (ISM), the gas and dust that floats around space, affects the radio signals from the pulsars. As a member of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves ([NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org/)) Collaboration, I help to use an array of pulsars across the sky (or pulsar timing arrays) to detect gravitational waves, ripples in space-time, that are emitted by supermassive black hole binary systems. My research as part of NANOGrav is primarily focused on timing the pulsars, determining when the pulses arrive at our telescopes and trying to model and predict them, and studying how the ISM affects the signals and adds noise to our data, and to try to model and mitigate those effects. 

I am also interested in searching for new pulsars, particularly in globular clusters, dense clusters of stars that have been found to host large populations of millisecond pulsars, pulsars that make a full rotation in less than 30 ms, and potentially other interesting objects, like intermediate mass black holes. Currently my research involves:

1. Helping to develop and write a new pulsar timing data analysis pipeline for NANOGrav which will be used to curate a data set for the detection of gravitational waves.
2. Writing and developing the [Pulsar Signal Simulator](https://github.com/PsrSigSim/PsrSigSim), a Python-based software package that can be used to simulate a pulsar signal from emission at the pulsar, through the ISM, observation by the telescope, and out in a common data format.
3. Using the Pulsar Signal Simulator to explore the covariances between different frequency dependent effects, like pulsar dispersion, pulse profile evolution, and pulse scattering by the ISM. This helps determine sources of noise in the pulsar timing data, and determine how accurate the pulsar timing models we find are.
4. Searching globular clusters for new millisecond pulsar systems.
