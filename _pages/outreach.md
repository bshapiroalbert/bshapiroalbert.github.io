title: "Science Outreach & Education"
---

I really enjoy science outreach and education, and I think it is one of, if not the, most important activity that scientists can engage in. Not only is it important to discuss our research and communicate it with the public, since as taxpayers they fund much of our research, but it’s the most effective way to get people excited about science. When students and adults alike can participate in science demonstrations (here in particular physics demos), they can learn and feel like they can understand and do science. It especially inspires students to follow STEM paths and become more science literate and learn critical thinking skills, which they will use throughout their lives. 

While I will not claim to be an expert, I have participated in and organized a number of different science outreach events, mostly through West Virginia University and the Physics and Astronomy Graduate Student Organization. I have volunteered at the Spark! Science Museum in Morgantown, WV for their science, space, and superhero days, presented physics demos at many elementary schools in and around Morgantown, WV for their STEM nights and also at the  Kids Day in the Park event hosted by the Katherine Johnson NASA IV&V Center in Fairmont, WV. I have also participated in the Adopt-a-Physicist online forum, which has been a fantastic way to engage with high school students around the United States.

The event I’m the most proud of though is the Community Physics Festival that I organized with another graduate student at WVU in July 2019. We organized a full day program of physics demos, public lab tours, arts and crafts, public lectures, and a solar filter on the WVU Department of Physics and Astronomy’s 16-in Celestron optical telescope. We also worked with the WVU Planetarium to run planetarium shows and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon Landing. The event was mostly run by undergraduate and graduate students, with 28 volunteers, and over 300 visitors over the course of the day.

More outreach events I have been a part of can be found on my CV, and I have a list of videos, activities, and other resources for scientists and students alike if you’re interested in learning more. If you’d like to talk more with me about science outreach I would be happy to hear from you!
