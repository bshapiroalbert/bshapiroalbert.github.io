I've done a lot of science writing throughout my career, from academic research papers to science writing for the public. Here you can find links to various articles I've published in many different places.

## Universe Sandbox Blog

My current job is as the science writer for [Universe Sandbox](http://universesandbox.com/), a physics-based space simulator masquerading as a video game.

You can read my blog posts about the science and simulation of Universe Sandbox (among other things) [here](https://universesandbox.com/blog/author/brent/).

## Astrobites

I also wrote for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/), summarizing academic journal articles for physics and astronomy undergraduates and enthusiasts.

If you're interested in my articles, you can find them [here](https://astrobites.org/author/bshapiroalbert/).

## Academic Papers

You can find a list of my publications at this [ADS link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/oUJ4aGDSRmSdoKLB_opc-Q).

This link includes papers I have led and papers I have been a co-author on.

If you are genuinely a masochist, you can [download my Ph.D. dissertation](https://github.com/bshapiroalbert/bshapiroalbert.github.io/blob/main/assets/files/Shapiro-Albert_Dissertation.pdf).
