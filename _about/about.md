I'm currently the Science Writer & Community Advocate for [Universe Sandbox](https://universesandbox.com/), a physics-based space simulator masquerading as a video game. I have the amazing job of interacting with our users and getting to write about all of the awesome science and simulations that Universe Sandbox can do (as well as its limitations).

Learn more about me and my story using the links to the left.
