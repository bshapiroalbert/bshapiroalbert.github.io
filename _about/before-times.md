Before I started working at Giant Army (the company that makes Universe Sandbox) I got my Ph.D. in physics from West Virginia University in Spring 2021. While in grad school, I worked for Prof. Maura McLaughlin and was a member of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves ([NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org/)) Collaboration, which uses pulsar timing arrays to detect nanohertz gravitational waves.

My research involved pulsars, pulsar timing, studying how the interstellar medium affects pulsar signals, and a little bit of searching the skies for new pulsars. More on that [here](research.md).
