In addition to science-related activities, I enjoy hiking, watching sports, brewing beer, reading (particularly fantasy and science fiction), and video games. 

Recently I've been reading Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archives, and I enjoy playing 2-D platforms, like Shovel Knight and Hollow Knight (though I like many other games too).
